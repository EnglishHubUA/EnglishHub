              <p class="reading__text">Once upon a time, in a beautiful forest, there lived a little bear named Benny. Benny was always very hungry, and he loved to eat yummy food. One sunny morning, he woke up and realized he had no food left in his cave.<br>
                Benny decided to go on an adventure to find some delicious food. He walked through the forest and saw a big tree with red apples. "Apples are my favorite!" Benny said with a big smile. He climbed the tree and picked some apples for his breakfast. <br>
                Next, Benny strolled to a nearby river. He was lucky because he loved fish, and he knew there were many fish in the river. Benny caught a big, shiny fish with his paws and was excited about his lunch.<br>
                As Benny was enjoying his fish, he saw a friendly rabbit hopping by. The rabbit said, "Hi, Benny! I have some carrots. Do you want some?" Benny loved carrots too, so he shared his fish with the rabbit, and they had a delicious meal together.<br>
                Benny was so happy with his food adventure. He realized that there was plenty of delicious food in the forest, and he would never go hungry. From that day on, Benny shared his food with his forest friends, and they all lived happily ever after.<br>
